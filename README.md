# Weather API website using PHP
### You can visit [the project website](https://sainaveen.great-site.net/weather/) for preview of the project

Enter the city name after visiting the website to know the current weather.

The website shows the current weather of any city with the help of json data received from https://openweathermap.org/ using API.

This project is to demonstrate my php skills in web development.
